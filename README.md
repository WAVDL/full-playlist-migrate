I've switched between music streaming providers a number of times and I don't think it should be as painful as it is. I especially don't think I should have to pay for a service that will migrate your playlists for you when I can do the same in just a few lines of code. So I wrote this for myself.

Currently it only supports Spotify -> Tidal as that's the most recent migration I made. I may expand it later. This was written for my personal use but feel free use it, learn from it, build off of it.

The only problems I ran into is some ISRC values I got from Spotify could not be found on Tidal. But I see that as a feature of my script that it will tell you which songs are not available on the destination service.

Okay thats it.
